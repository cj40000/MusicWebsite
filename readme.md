Website to meet other musicians in the area based off of musical tastes
### Problem Statement

It's hard enough to meet other musicians let alone other musicians that share a similar taste in music. This site aims to make that easier. 

One of the ways this site aims to do that, is by automatically showing you matches of others in your area that have selected the same artists/groups as their favorite. There will be later implementations to allow you to do specific searches based on your own criteria. 

Typical User experience:
Users signup then select their favorite music, and then they can see others in the area
that share the same taste in music. The match would be based off of a percentage of
how many bands/groups they share in common. The percentage would be determined by dividing
the number of shared musical interests by the number of musical interests chosen (uses the total
number of interests chosen from the user with the most interests). The users with the highest 
percent of matching interests would be displayed first in your results.
