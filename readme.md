# Website to meet other musicians in the area based off of musical tastes

Users signup then select their favorite music, and then they can see others in the area
that share the same taste in music. The match would be based off of a percentage of
how many bands/groups they share in common. The percentage would be determined by dividing
the number of shared musical interests by the number of musical interest chosen (uses the total
number of interests chosen from the user with the most interests). The users with highest 
percent of matching interests would be displayed first.
